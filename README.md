Some computational physics projects/code.

Active homogeneous is a python program that simulates an active fluid in shear flow. Newton's Method is used to solve for the dynamics of a nematic order parameter.


Finite methods is a python program that uses finite element analysis to determine the final temperature on a bar
attached to a wall, given an initial temperature, a function defining the bar over its length, and other parameters.


Finance is a python program that predicts the future of a particular stock via Monte Carlo methods, given its volatility, strike price, and other parameters.
