Fine.py , written in python 2.7

Enter the necessary constants as prompted, they are turned into floats
There is no erorr handling, so be careful there
(i.e h, T_inf, T_0, and so on)
The size of each elelemtn is assumed to be uniform

To change r(x), P(x), or A(x), change their function definition in 
the code itself

After entering the constants as prompted, the code runs itself, and 
then prints T to the screen. (T meaning the final temperature matrix)

The code only requires that numpy and scipy are installed
